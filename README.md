# Gender Classification

In order to predict gender of people shown in images four different face detection methods (Haar Cascade,Caffe,  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)  and  Histogram  of Oriented Gradients (HOG)) followed by classification via a CNN(Python/Keras)  were  used.  For  detecting  faces,  the  best  results were  achieved  by  using  HOG.  In  the  end  an  accuracy  of  about 76% correct classified people was reached. Excluding kids fromthe  final  analysis  the  accuracy  could  be  increased  up  to  92%.This  leads  back  to  the  lack  of  photos  of  kids  in  the  training dataset.
